Program Design:

This program simulates a rental car facility and acts as the point of sale for renting cars to customers. The point of sale tracks every sale made, total income daily income, and will run the rental dealership. I used observer, strategy, and factory patterns to help build a compartmentalized system that models the problem domain accurately.
